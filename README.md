  <h1>Github-Follow-N-Star-Action ‚≠ê</h1>
  
  A weekly `Github Actions` program that helps users follow back their Github followers & star their top-4 repositories. This repository uses `Github Actions` to automate this process and `Vercel` to simplify cloning this repository for users to their Github account.

## Initial Setup
1. **Clone The Repository** üë®‚Äçüî¨
    - [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSVENTRIPIKAL%2FGithub-Follow-N-Star-Action)

1. **Delete Data in your <a href="./EXPLORED_LOGINS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXPLORED_LOGINS</a> File** üìÑ

1. **Create Github Actions Workflow** üë®‚Äçüíª
    - Click *`Add File > Create New File`* in your Project Directory
    - Copy and Paste: 
        - *`.github/workflows/actions.yml`* as the Name of your File
        - The Contents from *<a href="https://github.com/SVENTRIPIKAL/Github-Follow-N-Star-Action/blob/main/.github/workflows/actions.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actions.yml</a>* into your File
    - Click *`Commit Changes`*

1. **Grant Workflow Read/Write Permission** ‚úçÔ∏è
    - *`{Cloned_Repo_Name} > Settings > Actions > General`*
    - Scroll Down to *`Workflow Permissions`*
    - Click *`Read and Write Permissions`*
    - Click *`Save`*

1. **Create Personal Access Token** ü•á
    - *[Account > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (Classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)*
    - Click *`Generate New Token > Generate New Token (Classic)`*
    - Name Your Token (example: *`GITHUB_API_FOLLOW_N_STAR`*)
    - Choose an Expiration Date
    - Select Scopes:
        - *`public_repo`*
        - *`read:user`*
        - *`user:follow`*
    - Click *`Generate Token`*
  > [!WARNING]
  > `Copy` your `Personal Access Token value` now. You won‚Äôt be able to see it again!

6. **Create Repository Secrets** ü§ê
    - *`{Cloned_Repo_Name} > Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`*
    
    - Create 2 Repository Secrets:
        1. ***PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN***
            - *`Bearer {Personal_Access_Token_Value}`*
            
        2. ***PERSONAL_USERNAME***
            - *`{Your_Github_Username}`*

7. **Profit** üí∏

## Running Actions Workflow
- **Manual:**
    - *Manual executions can be achieved by visiting the repository's `Actions` section, selecting the `Follow-N-Star-Action` workflow, and clicking `Run Workflow`*

- **Scheduled:**
    - *The program is scheduled to execute `@12pm every Wednesday`. This can be changed in the `.github/workflows/actions.yml` file by adjusting the `Cron Expression` to fit your needs*

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * WED'  # run @12pm every Wednesday (~4x/month)
```

---

## Actions Workflow Timing
- **Environment Setup:**
    - *~8 seconds*
      
- **Cost Per Follower:**
    - *~7.28 seconds*

## Github API Rate Limit & Actions Allowance
> [!IMPORTANT]
> API Limit: 5,000 requests per/Hour | Actions Allowance: 2,000 minutes (500MB) per/Month.

Using the new `Personal Access Token` created earlier for this repository, API rates will be limited to `5,000 requests per hour`, as well as a `2,000 minute (500MB) free monthly Actions` allowance. Currently, the program only has a protection in place to prevent exceeding the user API limit rate:
```python
def check_user_api_info(self, threshold=4000):
``` 
(`line-97` in the `model/github_api_client.py` file, which can be increased), so it's advised that users keep track of their `Actions` usage. Adjusting the `Cron Expression` to execute the program less times a month can also help with this as well.

> [!TIP]
> If the program stops early due to exceeding the `API threshold`, the workflow can be ran again after `1-hour` once the user's API rate limit has refreshed, since the program saves explored profiles to file and continues with those not saved to file (as long as `Actions` minutes remain).

## Running Project Locally
Cloning the project to your local machine may leave you with import errors in the python scripts. If your IDE does not automatically provide a solution for these, you will have to create a quick `virtual environment` in your `project directory` to install the requirements from the `terminal` & work from there.
> [!NOTE]
> For this project, make sure your IDE's `default interpreter` uses the environment's `python.exe` once it's created.
1. Create Environment:
    ```linux
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate Environment:
    ```linux
    source ./venv/Script/activate
    ```
3. Verify Python & Pip Executables:
    ```linux
    (venv)
    which python pip
    
    > .../venv/Scripts/python
    > .../venv/Scripts/pip
    ```
4. Install Project Requirements:
    ```linux
    (venv)
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```

    Once complete, your import errors should be gone and all `project requirements` can be found in `./venv/Lib/site-packages`
